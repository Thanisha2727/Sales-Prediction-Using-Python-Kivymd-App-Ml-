# Sales Predictor App

A mobile-optimized application built with KivyMD that predicts sales using multiple linear regression. The app provides an intuitive dark-themed interface for loading advertising datasets, training models, and visualizing prediction accuracy through interactive plots.

## Features

- **File Management**: Easy CSV file loading with built-in file browser
- **Data Preview**: Real-time dataset preview with row/column statistics
- **Machine Learning**: Linear regression model for sales prediction
- **Interactive Visualization**: Scatter plot showing prediction accuracy
- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark UI optimized for mobile devices (360x680)
- **Real-time Results**: Live R² score and MSE metrics display

## Screenshots

The app consists of two main screens:
- **Main Screen**: File loading, data preview, model training, and results
- **Results Screen**: Prediction accuracy visualization with scatter plot

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sales-predictor-app
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install kivymd pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

### 1. Load Dataset
- Tap "Choose File" to open the file manager
- Navigate to your advertising dataset
- Select a CSV file with the following structure:
  - **TV**: TV advertising budget
  - **Radio**: Radio advertising budget  
  - **Newspaper**: Newspaper advertising budget
  - **Sales**: Target variable (sales revenue)

### 2. Preview Data
- View the first 5 rows of your dataset
- Check dataset dimensions (rows × columns)
- Verify data format before training

### 3. Train Model
- Tap "Train Model" to start linear regression training
- View real-time R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Results appear instantly in the results card

### 4. View Predictions
- Tap "View Plot" to see prediction accuracy visualization
- Scatter plot shows actual vs predicted sales
- Perfect predictions align with the diagonal line
- Use "Back to Main" to return to the main screen

## Dataset Format

The app expects a CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Description | Type | Example Range |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| TV | TV advertising budget ($) | Float | 0-300 |
| Radio | Radio advertising budget ($) | Float | 0-50 |
| Newspaper | Newspaper advertising budget ($) | Float | 0-100 |
| Sales | Sales revenue ($1000s) | Float | 1-30 |

### Example Dataset Structure
```csv
TV,Radio,Newspaper,Sales
230.1,37.8,69.2,22.1
44.5,39.3,45.1,10.4
17.2,45.9,69.3,12.0
```

### Sample Dataset
You can use the classic [Advertising Dataset](https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv) for testing.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Multiple Linear Regression
- **Features**: TV, Radio, Newspaper advertising budgets
- **Target**: Sales revenue
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 ratio
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - R² Score (coefficient of determination)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- **Random State**: 42 (for reproducibility)

## Model Equation

```
Sales = β₀ + β₁(TV) + β₂(Radio) + β₃(Newspaper) + ε
```

Where:
- Sales = Predicted sales revenue
- TV, Radio, Newspaper = Advertising budgets
- β₀, β₁, β₂, β₃ = Model coefficients
- ε = Error term

## Performance Metrics

### R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- **Range**: 0 to 1
- **Interpretation**: Percentage of variance explained
- **Good Score**: > 0.7
- **Excellent Score**: > 0.9

### MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- **Range**: 0 to ∞
- **Interpretation**: Average squared prediction error
- **Lower is Better**: Closer to 0 indicates better accuracy

## Error Handling

The app includes error handling for:
- Invalid CSV file formats
- Missing required columns (TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales)
- Non-numeric data in feature columns
- File access permissions
- Model training failures
- Plot generation errors

## Performance

- **Training Time**: < 1 second (typical advertising datasets)
- **Memory Usage**: ~20-50MB
- **Supported Dataset Size**: Up to 100K rows
- **Typical R² Score**: 0.85-0.95 on advertising data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Error loading file"**
- Ensure CSV has required columns: TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales
- Check file permissions and accessibility
- Verify file is properly formatted CSV

**"Training error"**
- Ensure all feature columns contain numeric data
- Check for missing values in the dataset
- Verify Sales column exists and contains numeric values

**"Plot error"**
- Check available storage space for plot image
- Ensure matplotlib backend is properly configured
- Restart app if visualization consistently fails

**Low R² Score (< 0.5)**
- Dataset may not be suitable for linear regression
- Check for outliers in the data
- Consider feature engineering or different algorithms
